// Migrations provide a way to incrementally update our database schema and keep it in sync with the application's data model, all while preserving existing data.
// To generate, run, and revert migrations,
// TypeORM provides a CLI for migrations.
// Migrations are separate from the Nest application's source code,
// This is because their lifecycle is maintained by the TypeORM CLI.
// Since these migrations are outside of Nest, we are unable to leverage dependency injection and other features for the database migration.
